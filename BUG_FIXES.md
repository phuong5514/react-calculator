# Bug Fixes Summary

## Overview
This document details all the bug fixes made to the React Calculator app based on user feedback.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ History Button Placement (Mobile View)
**Problem:** History button was positioned in a fixed position at top-right, awkward on mobile.

**Solution:**
- Moved history button into the calculator header
- Placed it next to the theme toggle button in a flex container
- Updated CSS to style `.calculator__header-buttons` with proper spacing
- Removed old fixed positioning styles

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/Calculator.tsx`
- `src/style.css`

---

### 2. ✅ History Duplicates & Clear Not Working
**Problem:** 
- History items were duplicated
- Clear history button didn't work
- Items persisted across sessions causing accumulation

**Root Cause:** localStorage was storing items persistently, and each calculation would add to the already-persisted list.

**Solution:**
- Rewrote `HistoryStorage` to use in-memory cache only
- Removed all localStorage operations
- Changed from `private static STORAGE_KEY` to `private static memoryCache: HistoryItem[] | null`
- Updated ID generation to use `Date.now() + Math.random()` for true uniqueness
- History now clears on page refresh (session-based)

**Files Modified:**
- `src/utils/historyStorage.ts`
- `src/test/historyStorage.test.ts`

---

### 3. ✅ History List Not Refreshing When Open
**Problem:** When the history sidebar was open, new calculations didn't appear in the list until the sidebar was closed and reopened.

**Solution:**
- Added `refreshTrigger` prop to `HistorySidebar` component
- Modified `useCalculator` hook to accept `onHistoryUpdate` callback
- Calculator calls `setRefreshTrigger(prev => prev + 1)` after each calculation
- `HistorySidebar` re-loads data when `refreshTrigger` changes
- Added `refreshTrigger` to the `useEffect` dependency array

**Files Modified:**
- `src/hooks/useCalculator.ts`
- `src/components/Calculator.tsx`
- `src/components/HistorySidebar.tsx`

---

### 4. ✅ Memory Storage Duplicates
**Problem:** Similar to history, memory items could duplicate due to localStorage persistence.

**Solution:**
- Applied same fix as history storage
- Rewrote `MemoryStorage` to use in-memory cache only
- Removed localStorage operations
- Changed from `private static STORAGE_KEY` to `private static memoryCache: MemoryItem[] | null`
- Enhanced ID generation with `Date.now().toString() + Math.random().toString(36).substr(2, 9)`

**Files Modified:**
- `src/utils/memoryStorage.ts`
- `src/test/memoryStorage.test.ts`

---

### 5. ✅ Clicking History/Memory Items Appends Instead of Replaces
**Problem:** When clicking a history or memory item, the value was appended to the current display instead of replacing it entirely.

**Root Cause:** The `onSelectValue` handler was calling `calculator.inputDigit(value)` which appends digits.

**Solution:**
- Created new `replaceDisplay` function in `useCalculator` hook
- This function sets the display value and resets the calculator state:
  ```typescript
  const replaceDisplay = useCallback((value: string) => {
    setState(prev => ({
      ...prev,
      displayValue: value,
      waitingForOperand: true,
      previousValue: null,
      operator: null,
      expression: ''
    }));
  }, []);
  ```
- Updated `Calculator.tsx` to use `calculator.replaceDisplay(value)` instead of `calculator.inputDigit(value)`
- Clicking an item now replaces the entire display and clears any ongoing calculation

**Files Modified:**
- `src/hooks/useCalculator.ts`
- `src/components/Calculator.tsx`

---

### 6. ✅ Memory Buttons Operability
**Status:** Fixed by the in-memory storage rewrite

**Problem:** Memory buttons (MC, MR, M+, M-, MS) were not working properly.

**Solution:** The rewrite of `MemoryStorage` to use in-memory cache fixed the underlying issue. Memory buttons now:
- MC (Memory Clear): Clears all memory items
- MR (Memory Recall): Retrieves the most recent memory value
- M+ (Memory Add): Adds current display value to memory
- M- (Memory Subtract): Subtracts current display value from memory
- MS (Memory Store): Stores current display value as new memory item

**Files Modified:**
- `src/utils/memoryStorage.ts`

---

## Test Updates

### Updated Tests
All tests updated to reflect new in-memory behavior:

1. **historyStorage.test.ts:**
   - Renamed "Persistence" test suite to "In-Memory Storage"
   - Updated to verify localStorage is NOT used
   - Confirmed data is stored only in memory
   - All 9 tests passing ✅

2. **memoryStorage.test.ts:**
   - Renamed "Persistence" test suite to "In-Memory Storage"
   - Updated to verify localStorage is NOT used
   - Confirmed data is stored only in memory
   - All 11 tests passing ✅

3. **calculatorEngine.test.ts:**
   - No changes needed (23 tests still passing) ✅

### Test Results
```
✓ src/test/calculatorEngine.test.ts (23 tests)
✓ src/test/historyStorage.test.ts (9 tests)
✓ src/test/memoryStorage.test.ts (11 tests)

Test Files  3 passed (3)
Tests      43 passed (43)
```

## Technical Details

### Storage Architecture Change

**Before:**
```typescript
// Used localStorage for persistence
private static STORAGE_KEY = 'calculator_history';

static getAll(): HistoryItem[] {
  const stored = localStorage.getItem(this.STORAGE_KEY);
  return stored ? JSON.parse(stored) : [];
}

private static save(items: HistoryItem[]): void {
  localStorage.setItem(this.STORAGE_KEY, JSON.stringify(items));
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Uses in-memory cache only
private static memoryCache: HistoryItem[] | null = null;

static getAll(): HistoryItem[] {
  if (!this.memoryCache) {
    this.memoryCache = [];
  }
  return [...this.memoryCache];
}

// No save method - changes are immediate in memory
```

### Benefits of In-Memory Storage

1. **No Duplicates:** Each session starts fresh, preventing accumulation
2. **Faster Performance:** No I/O operations to localStorage
3. **Simpler Code:** Removed save/load/persistence logic
4. **Session-Based:** History/memory clears on page refresh (expected behavior)
5. **No State Sync Issues:** No need to sync between localStorage and React state

### ID Generation Improvement

**History Items:**
```typescript
// Combines timestamp with random number for uniqueness
id: Date.now() + Math.random()
```

**Memory Items:**
```typescript
// More entropy with base36 encoding
id: Date.now().toString() + Math.random().toString(36).substr(2, 9)
```

## Remaining Considerations

### Future Enhancements (Optional)
If localStorage persistence is needed in the future:
1. Use session-based keys (e.g., `calculator_history_${sessionId}`)
2. Implement proper state synchronization
3. Add storage quota checks
4. Handle storage errors gracefully

### User Experience Notes
- History and memory now clear on page refresh (intentional)
- This matches standard calculator behavior
- No more "stale" data from previous sessions
- Users can manually clear history/memory during session
